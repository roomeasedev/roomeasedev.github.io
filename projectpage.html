                                        <p>RoomEase is a roommate app that makes communicating with roommates and managing your household a lot easier.
										It provides five main features: reserving household items or places at certain times, writing shared lists among roommates,
										managing fridge content, scheduling chores, and a reminders feed.</p>

										<ol>
											<li>1. Lists are up and running

													<li>Users can add and remove lists, and list items that are

												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>2. Reservations are in progress
												<ul>
													<li>A basic version of the reservation system is working, but we are planning on
														making it a better experience for the user, giving it a cleaner interface
														and providing more information to the user in an efficient way. As of right now
														users can enter in the item they would like to reserve, a starting time, and a 
														duration. Reservation items can also be deleted by their creator.</li>

										<h3>Android Installation Instructions</h3>

											<li>1. Enable “unknown sources” on your phone.
												<ul>

												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>2. Download RoomEase.apk file on your Android.

													your home machine then import it to your phone.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>3. Install RoomEase.apk file.
												<ul>
													<li>Navigate to the directory where you saved RoomEase.apk. If you have not selected a specific directory then it will be available in “Downloads.” Press the app’s icon and an installation screen will pop-up. Tap “Install” and proceed with the installation. If Android was to issue any warnings during installation, ignore them and proceed.</li>

											<strong>User View: </strong> RoomEase consists of multiple views, each represents one of its main features. You can switch between views
											to add, modify, or delete items. Interacting with the app comes exclusively by pressing or hold-pressing items, and by typing.
											Although the different views look different, interactions with them are almost identical. Check the Using the Software section for
											more info about how to use the RoomEase app.
										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>Using the Software:   </strong>
											To run RoomEase, you need to have an active Facebook account.
											After you have successfully downloaded and installed the app, you should be able to access it by tapping on the
											RoomEase icon. RoomEase’s main screen will prompt you to login with your Facebook account, click “login with Facebook” and type your
											login cardinals then hit “proceed.”
											<img class="diagrams" src="images/MainPage-01.jpg" alt="Main Page 01" height="40%" width="40%"/>
											The app’s main page is the Feed page. It will provide with a scroll-down list of nearly-expired food, approaching chores, today’s
											completed chores, and today’s reservations. At the bottom of the page, or anytime by swiping left, you can choose from the Fridge View,
											the Chores View, the Reservation View, and the Lists View.
											<img class="diagrams" src="images/Fridge-01.jpg" alt="Main Page 01" height="40%" width="40%"/>
											On the Fridge View, you could toggle left to see your own food, or right to see the apartment’s shared food. Press-holding on any fridge item
											will allow you to modify it or delete it. Press-holding an expired item will give you the extra option of adding it to your grocery list.
											<img class="diagrams" src="images/List-01.jpg" alt="Main Page 01" height="40%" width="40%"/>
											From the List View, and every other view, you can tap on the big red plus sign on the bottom right allows you to add items to the displayed view.
											<img class="diagrams" src="images/Scheduler-01.jpg" alt="Main Page 01" height="40%" width="40%"/>
											On the Scheduler View, scheduled items and places are going to be displayed in order, nearest first. You either could add normally from the
											plus sign on the bottom right or choose to reserve a specific item by clicking on its icon on the top right.
										</p>
